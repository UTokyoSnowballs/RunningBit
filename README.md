This app was developed based on SleepBeta (https://sleepbeta.azurewebsites.net) for a capstone project in the course "Web Development in Cloud" (https://snowballsutokyo.wordpress.com). 

RunningBit works with Fitbit Charge 2 device and the Fitbit smartphone app. It helps runners reflect on their running routes and how their heart rate changes as a function of their running speed. 

RunningBit was developed based on the ASP.NET MVC framework. You will need to fill in the database connection string and Fitbit credential of your app (registered on Fitbit developer website) in the web.config file before you can deploy it.
